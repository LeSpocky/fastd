fastd v20
=========

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The OpenWrt init script has been migrated to *USE_PROCD*. This allows
  automatic restarts of fastd in the case of crashes.

  - The UCI options ``up`` and ``down`` have been removed, as their
    implementation was incompatible with procd-managed services. Use the options
    ``on_up`` and ``on_down`` instead.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* The *forward* feature was implemented incorrectly for configurations that use
  different encryption methods for different peers. As *forward* is generally
  disabled when running mesh routing protocols over fastd, affected
  configurations are very uncommon.

  - Packets forwarded from peers using the *null* method were not aligned
    correctly, which could lead to inferior performance or crashes on non-x86
    platforms.
  - Certain combinations of encryption methods led to crashes due to
    insuffucient buffer space, triggering an assertion failure.

Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The CMake-based build system of fastd has been replaced with the more modern
  `Meson <https://mesonbuild.com/>`_. Updated build instructions can be found
  in the :doc:`../devel/building` section.
* Memory management of fastd's packet buffers has been optimized, increasing
  throughput by 5~10% for many encryption methods, especially on low-end
  hardware.
* The fastd build requires at least Bison 2.6 now.
